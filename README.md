# Comment Pull Request - GitHub Actions

## What is it ?

A GitHub action that comments with a given message the pull request linked to the pushed branch.
You can even put dynamic data thanks to [Contexts and expression syntax](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/contexts-and-expression-syntax-for-github-actions).

## Usage

### Classic usage

```yml
on: pull_request

jobs:
  example_comment_pr:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: An example job to comment a PR
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Comment PR
        uses: thollander/actions-comment-pull-request@v2
        with:
          message: |
            Hello world ! :wave:
```

### Comment a file content

Thanks to the `filePath` input, a file content can be commented.
You can either pass an absolute filePath or a relative one that will be by default retrieved from `GITHUB_WORKSPACE`. 
(Note that if both a `message` and `filePath` are provided, `message` will take precedence.)

```yml
- name: PR comment with file
  uses: thollander/actions-comment-pull-request@v2
  with:
    filePath: /path/to/file.txt
```


### Setting reactions

You can also set some reactions on your comments through the `reactions` input.
It takes only valid reactions and adds it to the comment you've just created. (See https://docs.github.com/en/rest/reactions#reaction-types)

```yml
- name: PR comment with reactions
  uses: thollander/actions-comment-pull-request@v2
  with:
    message: |
      Hello world ! :wave:
    reactions: eyes, rocket
```

### Specifying which pull request to comment on

You can explicitly input which pull request should be commented on by passing the `pr_number` input.
That is particularly useful for manual workflow for instance (`workflow_run`).

```yml
...
- name: Comment PR
  uses: thollander/actions-comment-pull-request@v2
  with:
    message: |
      Hello world ! :wave:
    pr_number: 123 # This will comment on pull request #123
```


### Update a comment

Editing an existing comment is also possible thanks to the `comment_tag` input.

Thanks to this parameter, it will be possible to identify your comment and then to upsert on it. 
If the comment is not found at first, it will create a new comment.

_That is particularly interesting while committing multiple times in a PR and that you just want to have the last execution report printed. It avoids flooding the PR._

```yml
...
- name: Comment PR with execution number
  uses: thollander/actions-comment-pull-request@v2
  with:
    message: |
      _(execution **${{ github.run_id }}** / attempt **${{ github.run_attempt }}**)_
    comment_tag: execution
```

Note: the input `mode` can be used to either `upsert` (by default) or `recreate` the comment (= delete and create)

### Build

The build steps transpiles the `src/main.ts` to `lib/index.js` which is used in a NodeJS environment.
It is handled by `vercel/ncc` compiler.

```sh
$ npm run build
```
